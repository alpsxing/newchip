     u-boot is the third stage loader,
 
   - 1st stage is ROM Boot Loader, which searches for a
     second stage loader in SPI FLASH. 

   - 2nd stage using at most 16KB of on-chip SRAM, 
     responsible for lowlevel init, and for
     loading the third stage loader into DRAM.

   - 3rd stage, that's us!
